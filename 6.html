    <p>Feel the rhythm of the streets<br>
    Neon lights and neon dreams<br>
    Bloody fists they feel no pain<br>
    When there's so much more to gain<br>
    Hunting season if you will<br>
    Tell me where'd you'd rather be<br>
    I can hardly see th e moon<br>
    Hope we'll get there pretty soon<br>
    Trying so hard to release<br>
    You out of the misery<br>
    Hold on to your wishes<br>
    If you can't hold on to me<br>
    Forgive me for letting you down<br>
    Forgive me for letting you down again<br>
    I guess I'm not strong enough<br>
    Right now</p>

    <p>They will finally feel the flames<br>
    Flames that run down through my veins<br>
    I will make this city burn<br>
    We're not planning to return
    Trying so hard to be free<br>
    To make you see what I see<br>
    Hold on to your wishes<br>
    If you can't hold on to me<br>
    Forgive me for letting you down<br>
    Forgive me for letting you down again<br>
    I guess I'm not strong enough<br>
    Right now<br>
    Forgive me for letting you down<br>
    Forgive me for letting you down again<br>
    I guess I'm not strong enough<br>
    Right now<br>
    Oh my love<br>
    Oh my love<br>
    Loveee<br>
    Let you down<br>
    Oh, let you down<br>
    Let you down<br>
    Oh, let you down</p>
